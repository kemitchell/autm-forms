                  to Academic/ Not-for-Profit Organizations

This is in response to RECIPIENT’s request for the MATERIAL (specifically,
the name of the gene or allele mutation that makes the organism(s) unique)
      found within the        [organism strain, species], and any
unmodified derivative and unmodified progeny, as well as any biological
materials (including, without limitation: zygotes, embryos, cells, tissues,
fluids, etc.) which contain or incorporate the MATERIAL and are derived
directly from the original organism or its unmodified progeny, to be used
for the purpose of:       .

The PROVIDER requires that the RECIPIENT agree to and the RECIPIENT
SCIENTIST acknowledge the following terms before the RECIPIENT receives the

             ONCOMOUSE® ADDENDUM FOR USE IF NIH IS THE PROVIDER


NIH has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DuPont, in
which DuPont agrees that NIH may receive, use, and transfer mice containing
OncoMouse® technology to other entities for research purposes.  The MOU
states that NIH provide the following notice when shipping such mice.


The above MATERIALS are provided to RECIPIENT with knowledge of “Dupont
Patent Rights” (U.S. Patent 4,736,866, and 5,087,571, and 5,925,803 and
corresponding foreign patents, and any patents granted on any divisional
and continuation applications thereof (collectively known as “Harvard
Patent Rights”)), and that have been exclusively licensed to Dupont by
Harvard University, under the following conditions:


a) The RECIPIENT institution may use the MATERIAL for its internal
noncommercial research purposes only.  The Material will not be used for
any commercial purpose or for the direct benefit of any for-profit
institution (except as may be permitted under a written agreement between
the RECIPIENT and DuPont). Accordingly and without limitation, the
RECIPIENT is not permitted under this Material Transfer Agreement to use
any Material to test compounds for any commercial purpose or for the direct
benefit of any for-profit institution or use the Material for the
production of products for any commercial purpose or for the direct benefit
of any for-profit institution.


(b) The Material may not be transferred by the RECIPIENT to any third
parties (except as may be permitted under a written agreement between the
RECIPIENT and DuPont).


c) The RECIPIENT is notified by PHS of the existence of Harvard Patent
Rights and the exclusive license thereof to DuPont, and that the
restrictions set forth under (a) and (b) above shall exist only during the
term of the Harvard Patent Rights.


d) With respect to further license rights under the Harvard Patent Rights,
the RECIPIENT should contact:

           ANIMAL TRANSFER ADDENDUM FOR USE IF NIH IS THE PROVIDER


      The terms of this Addendum are directed to the use and transfer of the
      tangible animal(s).


      For transfers of any live animals from NIH to outside laboratories, a
      fully signed National Institutes of Health Animal Transfer Agreement
      should be completed by the parties prior to the actual shipment of the
      requested animal.  The Animal Transfer Agreement has been adopted for
      use by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for use in transferring
      animals for research purposes pursuant to Section 301 of the Public
      Health Service Act.




      The PROVIDER agrees to transfer the animal(s) containing the Material
      described in this Agreement to the RECIPIENT.


      RECIPIENT agrees to use the animal(s) solely in connection with
      biomedical or behavioral research.


      Relevant documents concerning the medical history, health status, and
      research uses of the animal(s), including prior surgical procedures
      and any infectious disease (human or zoonotic) to which the animal(s)
      may have been exposed, will be provided in a separate document.


      For domestic recipients, RECIPIENT agrees that it will comply with the
      Animal Welfare Act and its implementing regulations, as applicable.
      RECIPIENT agrees that it will adhere to all applicable national
      standards for humane care and use of the animal(s) and assures the
      PROVIDER that it has appropriate animal care and use policies in
      place.  The “Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of
      Laboratory Animals” and “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
      Animals” are examples of acceptable standards for humane care and use
      of research animals.


      RECIPIENT agrees that it will adhere to appropriate biosafety
      practices and use the animals in a safe and responsible manner.  The
      National Institutes of Health/Centers for Disease Control publication,
      “Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories” is an
      example of acceptable standards for biosafety practices.  RECIPIENT
      agrees that it will comply with applicable import/export regulations.


      In accepting the animal(s), RECIPIENT accepts full ownership, custody,
      and control of the animal(s), except that to the extent the Government
      has any patent, invention or any other intellectual property rights in
      the animal(s), the Government retains these rights.


      PROVIDER is transferring the animal(s) as a service to the research
      community.  The animal(s) is transferred to the RECIPIENT with no
      warranties, express or implied, including any warranty of
      merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  Unless
      prohibited by law from doing so, RECIPIENT agrees to hold the United
      States Government harmless and to indemnify the Government from all
      liabilities, demands, damages, expenses and losses arising out of the
      RECIPIENT’s care, use or treatment of the animal(s).


      RECIPIENT agrees not to claim, infer, or imply Governmental
      endorsement of the RECIPIENT, the research project, the institution or
      personnel conducting the research, or any resulting product(s).
